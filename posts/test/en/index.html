	As we all know, smart cities have become an important trend that is developing rapidly around the world. How can we make good use of technology and respond to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) so that urban governance can achieve both operational efficiency and safety, and it is also attracting global attention. Governments around the world attach great importance to it. An interdisciplinary team led by Professor Xiong Bo'an from the Department of Engineering at National Chung Cheng University recently received a national project from the Ministry of Science and Technology for "Research on Artificial Intelligence to Respond to Important National Challenges" and will introduce technology to solve important issues such as air pollution, river pollution and transportation. , build a complete set of sustainable smart monitoring center designs to create a trustworthy AI smart city that meets the well-being and efficiency of residents.

	The launch and consensus meeting of the Ministry of Science and Technology's 110-year artificial intelligence themed research project in response to important national challenges was held on the 15th at the Information Security and Smart Technology R&D Building of the Ministry of Science and Technology. It was chaired by Lin Mincong, Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the senior staff of National Chung Cheng University A cross-disciplinary team led by Professor Xiong Boan participated in the meeting. During the meeting, project launch and consensus discussions were held, with the hope of building a trustworthy AI sustainable smart city.

	According to United Nations estimates, 70% of the population will live in cities after 2050. Governments around the world are actively using information and communication technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and big data to develop urban governance. However, behind technology, there are deeper issues such as equality, rule of law, good governance, citizen trust and privacy, which will be an important cornerstone for the sustainable development of smart cities.

	Professor Xiong Boan and Associate Professor Jiang Zhenguo from the Department of Engineering of National Chung Cheng University, Professor Wang Xiangchen from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Professor Shi Huiling and Professor Liu Jianhong from the Department of Law, Professor Li Cuiping from the Department of Political Science, Professor Xu Weiyan from the Department of Asset Management, Associate Professor Huang Yongguang from the Department of Electronics of Yunlin University of Science and Technology, and Taitung University A cross-disciplinary team composed of Professor Huang Junxian from the Department of Engineering. The design of the Command and Control Center (ICCC) for a sustainable smart city is proposed, which will solve important problems in the traditional ICCC, including the inability of the system architecture to be updated in real time, blurry images in bad weather, and lack of integration of mobile UAV images. Terminal AI technology is not integrated, the administrative organization law does not respond to the development of smart cities, and the goals of sustainable development are not included in the scope of monitoring.

	Professor Xiong Boan said that the current plan will focus on key indicators such as combining AI edge terminals, image enhancement technology, automated deployment, trustworthy AI inspection mechanisms, and good governance by law. The planning team has a strong lineup and is composed of elite experts in the fields of artificial intelligence, imaging technology, law and society. All members have rich experience in promoting smart cities. Among them, Professor Xiong Boan, who serves as the chief planning host, has served as the director of Chiayi City in the past. Director of the Government's Smart Technology Department, he has achieved many outstanding achievements in promoting forward-looking smart urban and rural plans. In addition, teacher Jiang Zhenguo in the team has internationally leading AI core technology and won third place in the international smart city competition. name.

	Because only trustworthiness can lead a city to a sustainable future, the National Chung Cheng University team has three main development goals in its plan to design a command and monitoring center for a sustainable smart city: including the establishment of a trustworthy AI platform , AI human society, law and good governance, and sustainable smart city applications. It covers core technologies such as data management, automatic deployment of AI models, image enhancement, drone edge AI, air pollution detection, river pollution detection, cross-lens vehicle tracking, etc., and will complete relevant inspection standards and legal and good governance requirements. In the future, it will be implemented in a city in China and India, hoping to become a benchmark model for smart cities.

	This time, the cross-disciplinary team of National Chung Cheng University received a subsidy from the Ministry of Science and Technology for the "Artificial Intelligence Theme Research Project in Response to Important National Challenges." It is a national key project. It is an effort by the Ministry of Science and Technology to continue to enhance the momentum of China's AI research and use AI cutting-edge technology and The results respond to various challenges and important issues currently faced by our country, and enhance the international influence of our country's AI cutting-edge science. Therefore, the selection process of the project is rigorous and fierce. Among 68 applications from colleges and universities across the country, a total of 68 applications were finally approved. 13 "Theme Research Groups" and 4 "Core Attack Technologies".

	The project team includes 8 sub-projects, as shown in Figure 2. Four of the sub-projects (SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4) focus on the development of AI technology and platforms, and two sub-projects (SP5, SP6) focus on the rule of law. Good governance and social equality such as TAI indicators and two sub-projects (SP7, SP8) mainly implement AI in smart applications including environmental, air, water, pollution and transportation.

	Sub-project 2 is dedicated to realizing the deployment and sharing of artificial intelligence models to reduce the manpower consumed in model development, deployment and maintenance and improve efficiency. In addition, with the increasing reliance on intelligent machines, users’ requirements for transparent and explainable models have also increased. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to help users understand the operation and output results of models through explainable technology. Based on existing technology, this project further develops an end-to-end text explanation system for meaning understanding. Place it on the automation platform.
